### Description

Nutshell is a social media platform where users can share messages, articles, and events, as well as keep track of a task checklist. Once registered and logged in, the user will be presented with information about these items, as well as their list of friends. Messages are visible from all users across the website. If a user's friends have articles or events they have shared, those will be visible as well. Aside from the dashboard view, each item can be viewed on its own via the navigation bar.

### Instructions

To install and run the app:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. From the cloned directory, type ```npm start .```
3. Serve a database from the ```api``` folder in JSON-Server using port 5002. An ```example.json``` file is included in the repo.
4. Navigate to the app in your web browser. Default address is ```localhost:3000```
